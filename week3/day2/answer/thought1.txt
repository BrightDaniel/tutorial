(1) How can a number be divisible by 4 and 13?
	if the number is been divided by the product of 4 and 13
	and gives a remainder of 0.

(2) Define my known and unknown variables
	- let a = 4;
	- let b = 13;
	- let p = product of a and b
	- let Num = user input value.

(3) prompt my user to enter a value

(4) store that value and check for any of these conditions

(5) if my user's input divided by the product of a and b,
	gives a 0 remainder, then print: number is divisible 
 	by 4 and 13; otherwise print: number is not divisible 
	by 4 and 13.
(6) Stop.
