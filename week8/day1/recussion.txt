Recussion Definition:

When a function calls itself, thats recussion. It's not that difficult.
For example, remember in the main function, we call other functions we have created somewhere before. You also remember we can create other functions, imagine we created a function that is called void add(). now inside our function, we call add(), thats recussion. So that function is called recursive function. One important thing in recurssion is the terminator.
Eg 1. to see a case of simple recussion. Lets print out the sum of a number, and the factorial of a number.

Types of recussion

1 Direct recussion: If a function calls itself directly, that's recussion.

2 Indirect recussion:
